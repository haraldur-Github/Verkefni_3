of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called “plantains”,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>reynir</name></author><summary type="html">A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Off White Strip Plover Parker</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/15/off-white-strip-plover-parker.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Off White Strip Plover Parker" /><published>2018-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/09/15/off-white-strip-plover-parker</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/15/off-white-strip-plover-parker.html">&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible
berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large
hen’s egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) in
diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or
golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>halli</name></author><summary type="html">Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Off White Nike Zoom</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/14/off-white-nike-zoom.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Off White Nike Zoom" /><published>2018-09-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/09/14/off-white-nike-zoom</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/14/off-white-nike-zoom.html">&lt;p&gt;An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>bjalli</name></author><summary type="html">An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</summary></entry></feed>
